From - Julia Karlsson

* index.php#L14-L16 Be more consistent in links to stylesheets. Maybe store all in header.php and redirect. 
* Good structure in storing php features in the directory app.
* Use declare(strict_types=1); in all files that just contain php.
* login.php#L22 Using function redirect without declaring it. 
* search.php#L25-L32 If it’s possible try to not write html in php backend document. 
* It’s nice that you have created several css documents for each compontent. 
* Add a .gitignore file and ignore the images to reduce the projects size. 
* signup.php#L1-L3, L44 Open and close php without use. 
* Nice job creating an instagram clone!
